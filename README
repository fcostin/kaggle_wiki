[MAKING PREDICTIONS]

To run, place the "training.tsv" file in the original_data/ directory, then type "rake".

The complete procedure will probably take a couple of hours to complete.
Most of this time will be spent constructing the two tables of count data from the
training.tsv file.

The resulting file of predictions is saved as the file "gen/predictions.csv"

[DOCUMENTATION]

type "rake doc" to build "doc/description.pdf"

Read the Rakefile to see how the scripts are all glued together...

[TODO]
1. finish writing the docco
2. actually test the entire damn thing (urgh!)
